# LeetCode in Java

- Java code is formatted by [Language Support for Java(TM) by Red Hat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.java).
- Capable of being compiled with Java 8. It's sad that LeetCode doesn't support Java 13 in this moment.
- When dealing with string concatenation, use `StringBuilder` over `String` for better performance.
