# LeetCode Solutions

## Getting Started

In this repository, I'll work on solutions to **_all_** [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/) problems by C++, Java, and Python.

## Coding Style

> I believe messy code is costing you.

- **C++** code is formatted by [clang-format](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) following the [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Spaces_vs._Tabs). You can see the configuration [here](https://github.com/google/leveldb/blob/master/.clang-format).
- **Java** code is formatted by [Language Support for Java(TM) by Red Hat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.java).
- **Python** code is formatted by [PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

Besides, this is the [convention](CONVENTION.md) I follow for consistency.

## More Information

The repository is still under construction, and the goal is to keep up with the growth of LeetCode problems by Aug 2020!
